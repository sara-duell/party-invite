    <h2>Describe the last party you particularly enjoyed. What happened there? What was the structure? Were there tickets, performances, rituals, gifts?</h2>
    <div class="champagne-in-cambridge">
      <p>
          <marquee>
I was just talking about the best christmas celebration in my adult life, so that is the first thing that comes to mind. My friend Karolina from stockholm had just given birth to Ruth at the end of spring, and then at the end of summer she moved with her husband Jon to cambridge for a six month exchange at harvard. Ruth was one month old when she got her first passport. So for the first time since 2012 Karolina, Kira and I who all knew eachother from highschool were (basically) in the same place for christmas, and while in stockholm we would never celebrate together - as we&#39;d celebrate with our immediate families. So Kira and I who both live in new york travelled up to cambrige, I think maybe on the megabus. There has been a snow storm so it was so so so snowy everywhere which reminded us all of christmas in sweden. And it was just the perfect algamation of four people that really like eachother and who had very similar experations and hopes around christmas and a cute baby.

So we dressed up, drank champagne, made and ate delicious food, rhymed for our gifts, sang drinking songs,  light every candle and celebrated on the night of the 24th as we have always done. And then we took a nice long walk while the whole city was empty on the next day.

    <h3>How did you hear about this party? How were you invited?</h3>
    <div class="group-chat-planning">

        I think that as soon as we new that they were coming for the whole fall semester we all three descided that we&#39;d be celebrating christmas together. I&#39;m assuming that that this all was decided over some sort of group chat. And neither Karolina and Jon had an apartment to themselves in cambridge and I think both Kira and I had roommates so it made sense for us to be there.

    <h3>How did this party end? How was it cleaned up after?</h3>

It was a natural progression of all helping to cook, and then all helping to clean. And we were a bit drunk so the cleaning the night of wasn&#39;t too thorough, but then we all cleaned the next day. Feeling a bit outside here and a bit outside in stockholm, I felt extremly at home in this small apartment with people I&#39;ve known for more than a decade, and who are also people with a strong connection to sweden but with a strong desire to live abroad. All four (five with Ruth, now six with Knut) of us all currently live outside of sweden. So there was a perfect mix of old traditions and making new ones.
